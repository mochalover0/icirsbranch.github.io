**Why Join?**
In today’s world, rethinking waste is more important than ever. This workshop provides a unique opportunity for participants to engage with computational design tools, digital fabrication methods, and collaborative design approaches. Whether you're an architecture student, a designer, or a researcher, this hands-on experience will enhance your skills and broaden your design perspective.

**Workshop Structure**
The program consists of three exciting phases:

**Phase 1:** From Physical to Digital – Waste Autopsy (March 8, in-person)
Understand waste as a material and analyze its structural potential through digital tools.

**Phase 2:** In Digital – Computational Prototype Grammar (March 9, online)
Learn computational methods to redefine waste in digital environments using parametric design tools.

**Phase 3:** From Digital to Physical – Collective Construction (March 22, in-person)
Experience hands-on fabrication techniques and collectively build a structure using digitally processed waste materials.

**How to Apply?**
Submit your portfolio between March 1-6.
Basic knowledge of Rhino/Grasshopper is required.
The quota is limited to 25 participants, so apply early!
This workshop is led by an expert team of tutors and offers a great chance to experiment with digital design, sustainability, and innovative fabrication. Don’t miss this opportunity to redefine waste as a valuable design element!

**For application details, stay tuned!**
